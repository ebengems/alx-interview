This assignment entails turning a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise while it is already there, that is, without producing a new matrix.
My solution's approach is as follows:
    1. The matrix is first reflected along the diagonal with a negative slope, called the leading diagonal.
    2. Rotating the centre of the resulting matrix.
